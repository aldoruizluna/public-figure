# Aldo Ruiz Luna Portfolio & White-Label SaaS Webapp

This project is a robust, modular personal brand and portfolio webapp built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/). It is designed not only to showcase your expertise in advanced 3D fabrication, automation consulting, and creative expression, but also to be scalable into a white-label SaaS solution for multiple clients.

## Key Features

- **Modern Next.js Architecture:** No need for a traditional `index.html`—Next.js handles routing and rendering via the `pages` directory.
- **Modular & Scalable:** Built with a component-driven architecture for easy customization and white labeling.
- **Multilingual Support:** Powered by `i18next` and `react-i18next` to provide a seamless English/Spanish experience.
- **Dynamic 3D/VR Content:** Integrated A-Frame scenes for immersive 3D content.
- **Fully Responsive:** A mobile-first design that looks great on any device.
- **Extensible:** Ready to be enhanced with dynamic data, custom theming, an admin dashboard, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later is recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-portfolio-app.git
   cd my-portfolio-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or, if you use Yarn:
   # yarn install
   ```

### Running the Development Server

Start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view your webapp in the browser. The page will automatically reload if you make changes.

### Building & Deploying

To build the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

Then, to start the production server locally:

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
```

For deployment, you can host your Next.js app on platforms such as [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), or any Node‑compatible hosting service.

## Customization & White Labeling

- **Branding:**  
  Modify the file `config/branding.js` to update your brand’s name, logo, tagline, and other settings. This file makes it simple to swap out the branding for different white-label customers.

- **Internationalization:**  
  Update translation strings in `config/i18n.js` as needed. You can add more languages or adjust the existing English and Spanish content.

- **Styling:**  
  Global styles are defined in `styles/globals.css`. You can extend or override these styles using CSS modules, styled‑components, or your preferred styling method.

- **Components:**  
  The project is built with a modular architecture. All major sections (e.g., Hero, About, Services, Portfolio, Blog, Contact) are organized as separate components in the `components/` folder. This makes it easy to rearrange, extend, or even remove sections as your needs evolve.

- **Advanced Features:**  
  As you scale the project into a SaaS offering, consider adding:
  - An admin dashboard for managing content.
  - API routes for dynamic data (blog posts, portfolio items, etc.).
  - User authentication and multi-tenancy support.
  - Theming and custom styling per white-label customer.

## Additional Information

### About `index.html` in Next.js

In Next.js, you do **not** need a traditional `index.html` file. The homepage is rendered from `pages/index.js`, and the overall HTML document is managed by Next.js. If you need to customize the HTML structure, create a custom `pages/_document.js` file.
